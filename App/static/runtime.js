 * Build-time switches.

 * export, cleanup operations - keys off this one flag, so there is a single place
 * to look when asking "is this build talking to a server?".
 *
 * A meta tag rather than an inline script on purpose: the build runs under
 * `script-src 'self'`, which blocks inline scripts. Modules are deferred, so the
 * head is parsed by the time this runs.
